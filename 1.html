<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>
	JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming
	language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web,
	alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the
	client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
