		<h1>JavaScripts</h1>

		JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming
		language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web,
		alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on
		the client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party
		libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to
		execute the code on users' devices.
